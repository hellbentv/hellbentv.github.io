## Overview

LCU14, its a wrap.  Now that I'm back, the week seems to be a complete blur. The
week started on Sunday with the management team looking at a few challenges
facing Linaro.  Topics discussed include growth, scaling, silos, member
engagement and our roadmap process. Though there will likely be only a few
quick changes, the feedback from these sessions will be a topic of ongoing
discussions and changes for the Linaro executives.
