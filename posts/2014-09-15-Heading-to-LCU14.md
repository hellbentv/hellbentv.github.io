# It's that time again

Every few months, the team at Linaro comes together to hold formal and informal
meetings.  These events are often on un-familiar ground, allowing the teams to
hold discussions nearly around the clock.  The discussions are non-stop,
starting early in the morning and carrying on throughout the day.  At the end
of the day, teams may get together and continue earlier discussions or talk
about other hobbies, and end up returning to our hotel rooms to draft up daily
summaries late into the night only to start the whole thing over for 5-6 days
in a row.  All in all, the event is exhausting.

The LAVA, Toolchain and LSK teams have a full schedule

**LCU14-201: Binary Analysis Tools**

This session will be a presentation about currently available binary analysis
tools, including: Sanitizers, perf (a performance counter and tracing profiling
tool), record/replay (a reverse debugging facility in GDB) and prelink rootfs.

**LCU14-203: LAVA Use Cases: Upstream Kernel CI**

This session will provide a short summary on how Linaro teams are automating
upstream Kernel CI with a goal to improve the overall Linux on ARM ecosystem.
The second half of the session will be general Q&A

**LCU14-205: Multi-arch compiler driver**

This session will provide an overview of the foundations of a multi-arch
compiler driver and discuss necessary support in GCC, LLVM, multi-arch
enablement (in both), and bug reporting. The eventual goal of a unified driver
will be a compiler driver that has a common set of feature flags that can invoke
the desired compiler, which will then generate consistent results between
compilers.

**LCU14-207: LAVA status update and refactoring the lava-dispatcher**

The LAVA team will present the current status of the LAVA product and highlight
the the in-progress dispatcher re-factoring.

**LCU14-209: LLVM Linux**

This session will provide an update on the status of the LLVMLinux project; a
project which is cooperating with both the Linux kernel and LLVM communities to
build the Linux kernel with Clang/LLVM. This talk will also cover new things in
LLVM which make clang even more attractive to the kernel community. LLVM is an
extensive compiler technology suite which is already commonplace from
Android/Renderscript and OpenCL through to high performance computing clusters.

**LCU14-211: LAVA Use Cases: SW testing & Reproducing a LAVA failures locally using CARE**

The session will cover: Means to collect the data from Jenkins and LAVA
End-to-end result presentation (build status, build warnings, automated testing,
manual testing) Reporting of weekly/monthly testing results The session is
meant to show the currently implemented solution and collect feedback/requests
from current and potential users.

**LCU14-307: Advanced Toolchain Usage (Part 1&2)**

This set of sessions will go into detail on many toolchain topics and help the
attendee get the most out of their toolchain usage. Topics covered will include:
inline assembly Link Time Optimizations (LTO) Feedback Directed Optimizations
(FDO) Proper code annotation for: promoting vectorization avoiding false
sharing memory aliasing restrict keyword usage Optimization levels and what they
mean Demystifying -march, -mfpu, -mcpu, -mtune, -with-mode Linking options
Libatomic usage Debugging binaries compiled with optimizations.
